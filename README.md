# Example of your `index.js`

```javascript
const bridge = require("cloud-chat-bridge");

// Your secret variables, see following for details
const vars = require("./secret.json");
const app = bridge.init({vars});

// Your rules to bridge messages, see following for details
const rules = require("./rules");
const endpoint = app.webhook(rules);

exports.webhook = endpoint;
```

# Example rules

```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    // From any groups of LINE
    "source": {
      "group": /.*/
    },
    // To "random" channel of Slack
    "destination": {
      "service": "Slack",
      "channels": ["random"]
    }
  }
]
```

# Variables you might need

`secret.json`, like this

```json
{
  "LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET": "XXXXXX",
  "LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "XXX",
  "SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/ZZZ"
