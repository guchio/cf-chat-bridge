const vars = require("./secret.json");
const app = bridge.init({vars});

// Your rules to bridge messages, see following for details
const rules = require("./rules");
const endpoint = app.webhook(rules);

exports.foobar = endpoint;
```

# Example rules

```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    // From any groups of LINE
    "source": {
      "group": /.*/
    },
    // To "random" channel of Slack
    "destination": {
      "service": "Slack",
      "channels": ["random"]
    }
